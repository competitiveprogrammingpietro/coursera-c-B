Project
-------

The project implements the Hex game. The spirit is to understand and use most of the C++11 and onwards features
by writing a non-trivial program. The AI is a Montecarlo simulation and a graph implement the Hex board.

This is the main homework - developed in stages - for the Coursera course
`https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-b/home/week/4`

Building
-------

The project it's straightforwared to compile, just issue to generate an executable a.out:

g++ HexBoard.cpp -o hex -lpthread

The executable asks the end user a few information and the game starts.
